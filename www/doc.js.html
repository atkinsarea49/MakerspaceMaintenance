/**
 * Functions and objects and such that have to do with the form input.
 * @namespace FormInput
 */

/**
 * Functions for each individual machine input.
 * @namespace Machines
 * @memberof FormInput
 */

/**
 * Machine functions that allow the user to input multiple selections for one or more questions
 * as opposed to just one. This means that the multiselect questions need to be formatted and
 * split up so that each selection can have its own entry.
 * 
 * @namespace MultiSelect
 * @memberof Machines
 * 
 * ## Structure
 * 
 * All of the values we get from the form entry are from the "json" parameter that is passed to
 * the function
 * 
 * ### Range
 * 
 * We get the range of spreadsheet cells that we are going to be working with. This is a constant,
 * meaning that this value will not change. We can then access this value within our function by
 * calling "range".
 * 
 * @example
 * const range = sheet.getRange('A5:E');
 * 
 * ### List
 * Now we get the list of values that the user selected in the multiselect question.
 * By using "stringify" on the value, we convert the list from json to a string
 * (plain text that we can use in the spreadsheet) In this example, the list we are
 * getting is the list of machines that the user performed the task on, but this 
 * can vary based on the individual function.
 * 
 * @example
 * var machineList = JSON.stringify([json.values[5]])
 * 
 * ### Convert the String to an Array
 * 
 * Next we will convert this string to an array, which is basically a single variable
 * that holds a list of objects instead of just one. Here is an example of an array:
 * 
 * ```
 * const myArray = ["string 1", "string 2", "string 3"]
 * ```
 * 
 * Each object in this array can be accessed by calling the variable name with the index
 * (the object's number in the sequence, starting with 0).
 * 
 * ```
 * myArray[0] //gives you the value "string 1"
 * ```
 * We will use the following code to remove all the characters that will get in the way
 * of creating a nice, clean array, such as brackets and quotes. 
 * 
 * @function replace Looks for the first value, then replaces it with the second value
 * @function replaceAll Looks for a longer string of values, then replaces it with the second value
 * 
 * @example
 * machineList = machineList.replaceAll(", ", ',');
 * machineList = machineList.replace("[",'')
 * machineList = machineList.replace("]", '')
 * machineList = machineList.replace('"', '')
 * machineList = machineList.replace('"', '')
 * 
 *
